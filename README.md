# Analysis of Motor Vehicle Collisions in Nova Scotia
## Description
This project provides a statistical analysis of motor vehicle collision data in Nova Scotia. We employ various exploratory data analysis techniques and visualizations to identify key factors contributing to accidents. The study uses R for data processing and visualization.

## Project Goals
Understand the distribution and trends of motor vehicle collisions in Nova Scotia.
Identify high-risk factors and conditions that lead to accidents.
Create insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Dataset
Source: Motor vehicle collision data provided by government or open data sources.
Features: Includes variables such as date, time, location, weather conditions, and collision outcomes.
Data Format: CSV format, processed and analyzed in R.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, you need to install R and the following packages:
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "lubridate", "readr"))

## Project Setup
Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-link>
Open the R Markdown file  in RStudio.
Install the required packages as listed above.
Knit the R Markdown file to generate an HTML report with the analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Data Cleaning and Processing
Handling Missing Values: Impute or remove missing data points for accurate analysis.
Date and Time Parsing: Use the lubridate package to format and extract date-time components.
### Visualizations
Collision Trends: Line graphs showing the number of collisions over time.
Heat Maps: Visualize accident hotspots across different locations in Nova Scotia.
Bar Plots: Display the frequency of collisions under various weather conditions.
### Statistical Analysis
Summary Statistics: Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for key variables.
Correlation Analysis: Assess the relationship between factors such as weather and collision frequency.
### Results
Key Findings: Summarize important trends, such as peak collision times and conditions that increase risk.
Insights: Highlight critical factors influencing motor vehicle collisions, aiding in preventative measures.

## Challenges and Future Work
### Challenges: Data quality issues, such as missing values and inconsistent formats.
### Future Work: Incorporate machine learning models for predictive analysis and extend the study to include more variables.
